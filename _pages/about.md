I am an undergraduate at Zhejiang University, majoring in statistics. I have worked with Prof. [Yang Yang](http://yangy.org/) and Prof. [Xiaoye Miao](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/miaoxy_en#0) on several projects about time series mining. Currently, I am work with [YaleNLP](https://yale-nlp.github.io/) group on for LLM evaluations and information retrieval. 

My research interest includes natural language processing and time series data mining. I am broadly interested in LLM reasoning and evaluation.
