<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently an undergraduate student at Zhejiang University, majoring in Statistics, and will be joining the Language Technologies Institute at the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University as a master‚Äôs student soon. I am now working as a research intern at Alibaba Group, focusing on large-scale reinforcement learning to enhance the agentic product search capabilities of LLMs.

Previously, I collaborated with [YaleNLP](https://yale-nlp.github.io/) group on LLM evaluations and information retrieval. I have also worked with Prof. [Yang Yang](http://yangy.org/) on AI4Science (Foundation models for brain signal decoding, COOL!).
